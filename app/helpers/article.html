The Endgame of Dawntrail

So it's been more than 5 months since the global release of the critically acclaimed MMO and it's near the end of the
year where we can see what has become of the game. The game was in need of a new direction due to the ending of the
Hydaelyn and Zodiark tale. We embarked on a new adventure far across the ocean, to the west, and we went on to discover
the Golden City.

We are now in <a

    7.15</a> , we have cleared the new <a
    href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/duty/cc1de0a3c10/" class="eorzeadb_link">Lightheavyweight</a> raids and we
have just begun the 24 man raid inspired by the world of this game's predecessor, Final Fantasy XI. The new story has
come a long way since its release and players want to continue on the never ending journey. There's a new noteworthy
activity never heard of before, a higher level difficulty for one of the most iconic boss battles, Cloud of Darkness
(Chaotic).

We have also received a new entry in the highest difficult content type in the game, Futures Rewritten Ultimate (FRU),
inspired by the raid series introduced in the Shadowbringers expansion, which has several elements from FFVIII such as
music, boss enemy designs and the overall arena design of the fights, of course players went on to participate in the
world's first race.

For some reason, we still have more Hildibrand adventures and I am sure we want to continue our journey with â€œThe best
looking guy" in all of Eorzea. We can't leave behind the players whom, above all, want us to wear the latest fashion and
who will provide us with powerful gear (for a reasonable price of course) to survive countless battles, crafters and
gatherers continue creating new items non-stop in front of marketboards of Limsa, as usual, and they are on the quest to
compete in the markets with some of the latest and most exquisite housing items

Overall the game has had a few changes, but it still preserves the same experience that veteran players love the most,
while adding new elements like Tattered sheet music rewards to claim the latest Orchestrion Rolls for the latest 24 man
raid.
